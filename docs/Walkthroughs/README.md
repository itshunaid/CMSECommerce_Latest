# UI Walkthroughs and Screenshots

This folder can contain step-by-step annotated screenshots of the application UI. Add images in `docs/Walkthroughs/images/` and reference them from markdown files.

Suggested walkthroughs to add:
- Admin: Approve / Reject product (screenshots of admin product list, modal, and email notification)
- Admin: View Order Details (admin orders list -> details screen)
- Developer: Run locally and apply migrations (screenshots of Visual Studio / terminal commands)

I cannot create screenshots automatically. To complete walkthroughs:
1. Run the app locally and open the relevant pages.
2. Take screenshots and save them into `docs/Walkthroughs/images/`.
3. Create markdown files that reference these images and annotate steps.

If you want, I can generate the markdown scaffolding for each walkthrough file now. Provide screenshots and I will embed them into the walkthroughs.
