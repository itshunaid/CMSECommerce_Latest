This document outlines key strategic questions and technical review points intended to strengthen the platform and help it evolve into a sustainable and scalable ecosystem.

### 1. Product Positioning
* **Market Identity:** How is Weypaari positioned in the broader market? 
    * Is the intent to be a general-purpose marketplace?
    * Or is it a curated niche platform exclusively for Mumenaat home industries?
* **Competitive Differentiation:** Beyond community alignment, what is the key unique selling proposition (USP) that differentiates Weypaari from existing horizontal marketplaces?

### 2. Core Value Proposition
* **Stakeholder Benefits:** What is the primary value offered to:
    * **Mumenaat Sellers:** Why should they prefer Weypaari over informal selling via Instagram or WhatsApp groups?
    * **End Customers:** What specific problem does Weypaari solve more effectively than current alternatives?
* **Structural Friction:** Weypaari aims to solve the "structural friction" of informal commerce. How does the architecture specifically provide the tools to conduct business without the typical overhead of a global marketplace?

### 3. Target Customer Definition
* **Audience Scope:** Who is the primary target audience?
    * Exclusive community-only buyers?

    * Centralized logistics support, or
    * Seller-managed shipping?
* **Integration:** Are any logistics or courier partners currently integrated or planned for integration?

    * **Key Partners:** Who are the essential collaborators?
    * **Major Cost Heads:** Where are the primary expenditures?
